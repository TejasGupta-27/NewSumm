Amid escalating trade tensions, with China announcing duties of 34 per cent on all US imports in retaliation to Donald Trump’s tariffs, senior government officials in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry held a top-level meeting to assess a potential surge in imports following the implementation of reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 9, The Indian Express has learned.

Concerns over a surge in imports from China stem from the likelihood of an increased glut in Chinese exports, following the imposition of a 34 per cent US reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods on top of the 20 per cent announced earlier by Trump. Trade officials are evaluating this possibility as China’s overcapacity was already a concern even before the latest US tariff measures.

What this means
The 34% tariff makes it very difficult for US agricultural products to enter China. At the same time, experts believe this opens a window for other exporters like Australia and Brazil to increase their market share in China.

Exporters, especially steel manufacturers, had raised concerns with the government following Trump’s decision to impose 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium. In response, the Commerce and Industry Ministry, already investigating dumping, recommended that the Finance Ministry impose a 12 per cent safeguard duty on steel. This came despite protest from the small scale industry surge in steel cost due to the steel duty.



This strategy differs from the approach taken during the first Trump administration when India responded to steel and aluminium tariffs with countermeasures.

Meanwhile, economists and trade experts have also echoed concerns over a surge in exports from China. A research note by HDFC Bank Friday stated that apart from the direct impact of US tariffs on Indian exports, India faces a “high risk” of oversupply from China, which could hurt domestic manufacturing.
